# Image Kernel Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an ipynb file demonstrating image kernel analysis. The core functionality involves implementing a convolution function from scratch using numpy. Subsequently, various types of image kernels are applied to a cat image to produce different output images. Additionally, random salt and pepper noise is introduced into the input image using the random function. The convolution operation is then performed with different image kernels to observe how the noise is offset.
